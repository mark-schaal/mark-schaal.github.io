We've all been there. You've researched GitFlows, you've gotten a process down that involves issues queues, branches and pull requests. But you've done the unspeakable: you've started work on multiple features outside of branch management. How do we go back? How do we separate our work and keep our flow intact?

As a developer, I believe that Git is one of the most powerful tools in my daily rotation, and that `git stash` is one of my most frequented Git commands. Whether I am reviewing someone else's code, preventing partial commits on incomplete features, or just trying to troubleshoot a piece of functionality, `git stash` allows me to quickly jump between code states without losing work or committing low-quality code to the repository.

In this post, I'll discuss another useful feature with `git stash`, which is the capability to conditionally apply stashed code changes based on specific file needs. Historically, when you apply a `git stash`, you are applying everything in the latest version of a stash, or a specified stash index to the current branch (Note: You may also apply the stash index directly to a new branch. For more on that and other stash capabilities, see [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing)).

**Stashing our initial changeset:**

~~~ git
$ git stash;
$ git stash show;
~~~

**Applying the first set of feature changes to a new branch:**

~~~ git
$ git checkout -b "feature-branch-first";
$ git checkout stash@{0} -- path/to/file.name
$ git add path/to/file.name
$ git commit -m "First feature branch changes."
~~~

**Applying the second set of feature changes to a new branch:**

~~~ git
$ git checkout -b "feature-branch-second";
$ git checkout stash@{0} -- path/to/file.name
$ git add path/to/other/file.name
$ git commit -m "Second feature branch changes."
~~~

And it's as easy as that. Of course, you'd probably want to perform a `git merge` between your branches to ensure the code carries along the same state, but overall you are ready to reunite your work with your team's feature branch workflow.
