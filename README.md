# Mark-Schaal Public Website GitHub Hosting

## Getting Started
1.  Clone the repository    
``` $ git clone https://github.com/mark-schaal/mark-schaal.github.io; ```   
2.  Serve the Jekyll Web Application     
``` $ bundle exec jekyll serve;```    

Note: This should be performed from the application root using the `bundle` gem functionality. Failing to use `bundle` command will result in the Jekyll system being served from the current directory you are navigating within (as opposed to the `_site` directory).
